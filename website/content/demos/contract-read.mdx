## The `useContractRead` hook

The `useContractRead` hook is used to make a read-only call to a smart contract.

The hook takes the following parameters:

- `abi`: the smart contract ABI. Generated by Scarb and available from block explorers.
- `address`: the smart contract address.
- `functionName`: the function being invoked.
- `args`: function arguments.
- `blockIdentifier`: make a call against a specific block number, or the latest or pending block.

```tsx
const { chain } = useNetwork();

const { data, refetch, fetchStatus, status } = useContractRead({
  abi: [
    {
      inputs: [],
      name: "symbol",
      outputs: [
        {
          name: "symbol",
          type: "felt",
        },
      ],
      stateMutability: "view",
      type: "function",
    },
  ],
  functionName: "symbol",
  address: chain.nativeCurrency.address,
  args: [],
  watch: true,
  blockIdentifier:
    blockIdentifier === "latest" ? BlockTag.latest : BlockTag.pending,
});
```

## Refreshing data

You can refresh data either manually or automatically.

- Manually: call the `refetch` function.
- Automatically (default): if `watch` is true and the `blockIdentifier` is `BlockTag.latest`, the hook will
  refresh data on every new block. If it's `BlockTag.pending`, data is refreshed
  every few seconds.
- Automatically (custom): set `watch` to true and use the `refetchInterval` parameter to change
  how data is refreshed. Set it to `false` to always disable refreshing data, or
  specify a custom interval.
